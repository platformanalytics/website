  The 2023 Workshop on Platform Analytics (WoPA) is a single-track, multidisciplinary workshop presenting new research on platform analytics. 

<p>
Platforms enable direct interactions between diverse groups of agents. Marketplaces connect buyers and sellers; media platforms connect advertisers, creators and viewers; sharing platforms connect resource owners with resource users; app stores connect developers and users. Platforms are pervasive in the digital economy. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11002-014-9314-1" target="_blank">Sriram et al. (2014)</a> cover some platform research topics in greater depth and point to foundational literature.

<p>
We construe Platform Analytics broadly as the use of data to improve decisions in platform contexts. Relevant decisions might include platform design, rankings, listings, usage, pricing, advertising, personalization, ratings or reviews. Relevant topics might include: 
<br>-network externalities;
<br>-agent utility, search, matching, purchase or welfare;
<br>-reputation, manipulation, trust or fraud;
<br>-discrimination, diversity or fairness;
<br>-competition within or between platforms;
<br>-data privacy and sharing;
<br>-antitrust or other regulations.
<br>Ideal papers might show how to use platform data to improve decisions in platform contexts.

<p>
WoPA will be held in-person in San Diego on April 7, 2023, and last the full day. The organizers are Minkyung Kim (UNC), Davide Proserpio (USC) and Kenneth C. Wilbur (UCSD). The workshop is sponsored by the <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty-research/usc-marshall-initiative-digital-competition">USC Marshall Initiative on Digital Competition</a>.

<p>
We invite working papers on platform analytics for a competitive submission process. We welcome relevant submissions from industry or any academic discipline, including computer science, economics, information systems, marketing, operations or others. Please send full papers to workshoponplatformanalytics@gmail.com by November 1, 2022. 

<p>
We will notify authors of accepted papers in December. Submitting authors will be invited for priority registration. The program will be posted at <a href="https://platformanalytics.org">PlatformAnalytics.org</a>. 

<p>
We kindly ask for help distributing this announcement to interested researchers.
