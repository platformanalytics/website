    <b>Travel to San Diego</b></summary>
  <p>
   A few things that may not be obvious:
   <p>
     1. Domestic travelers to San Diego airport (code: SAN) may want to search <a href="https://www.southwest.com/">Southwest Airlines</a> as well as regular flight search engines.
    <p>
     2. The John Wayne Airport (code: SNA) in Irvine is a 60-90-minute drive from UCSD. 
      <p>
     3. The Tijuana International Airport (code: TIJ) is about a 35-45-minute drive from UCSD. A pedestrian bridge called the <a href="https://www.crossborderxpress.com/en/">Cross-Border Express</a> enables air travelers to disembark directly into the United States. Some international flights to TIJ are substantially cheaper than similar flights to SAN.
      <p>
     4. Those traveling within Southern California may consider the Pacific Surfliner. Train service between Irvine and Oceanside was suspended on Sept. 30 due to erosion in San Clemente but a "bus bridge" operates. <a href="https://www.pacificsurfliner.com/plan-your-trip/alerts/travel-advisories/">This website</a> has more information and updates.
     <p>
     5. If you fly into LAX, be advised that public transit options between Los Angeles and San Diego are limited. Consider renting a car.

    <b>Accommodation</b> </summary>
<p>
We recommend the following options:
  <p>
    1. The <a href="https://www.estancialajolla.com" target="_blank">Estancia La Jolla</a> is a lovely boutique hotel within easy walking distance, but expensive. <a href="https://www.lodgetorreypines.com/" target="_blank">The Lodge at Torrey Pines</a> and <a href="https://www.ljbtc.com/" target="_blank">La Jolla Beach & Tennis Club</a> are in a similar class but not quite as close. We would recommend booking these properties early.
    <p>
    2. Other convenient hotels within 2-3 miles include <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/santphh-hilton-la-jolla-torrey-pines/" target="_blank">Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines</a>, <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lajca-residence-inn-san-diego-la-jolla/overview/" target="_blank">Residence Inn by Marriott</a>, <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lajca-residence-inn-san-diego-la-jolla/overview/" target="_blank">Sheraton La Jolla</a>, and <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/california/hyatt-regency-la-jolla-at-aventine/jolla" target="_blank">Hyatt Regency La Jolla At Aventine</a>.
    <p>
    3. San Diego has numerous other accommodation options. We recommend checking <a href="https://www.hotelscombined.com/" target="_blank">Hotels Combined</a> or <a href="https://airbnb.com/" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>. You may want to consider staying near the Blue Line Trolley if you do not rent a car. Or, you could stay in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bQy3Y8qfKRs5YdAt7" target="_blank">Village of La Jolla</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LexTLJKudHnj1zjV7" target="_blank">La Jolla Shores</a>, and rely on ride-sharing services or the MTS 30 bus.

  <p>
    <details>
  <summary>
    <b>Arriving at UCSD</b></summary>
<p>
  1. The workshop will be held at the UCSD Rady School of Management. We recommend taxi or ride sharing services like Uber or Lyft as the easiest way to get to the Rady School, because they do not require walking or parking. We recommend <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EoZSeUY8SrpMsvRM8">this point</a> for drop-off and pick-up.
    <p>
  2. The UC San Diego Trolley Blue Line began operation in 2020 and connects UCSD to Downtown San Diego and the US/Mexico Border. Trolley cars run every 15 minutes and fares can be paid on the <a href="https://www.sdmts.com/fares/pronto">PRONTO app</a>. We cautiously recommend using the trolley, with two caveats as it may not be the best option for everyone. First, the UCSD Pepper Canyon stop is about a 20-minute walk from the Rady School, including a large hill. Second, the trolley is reliably busy and safe during rush hour, but off-peak ridership is less predictable.
  <p>
  3. Driving directions to the Rady School are <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/connect/visit/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
  <p>
  4. Drivers can use <a href="https://transportation.ucsd.edu/visit/visitor/index.html">UCSD Visitor Parking</a> for $4/hour, up to a maximum of $32/day. However, the number of visitor parking spaces is limited and may require search across multiple parking lots. 
  <p>
  5. There are some free parking spaces in an unpaved lot at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/D4h5iYWuzzP59WFe7">Torrey Pines Gliderport</a> or curbside on nearby Torrey Pines Scenic Dr, a 15-minute walk to the workshop site. The lot usually fills up on weekday mornings, but spaces may be available early Saturday.

  <summary><b>Call for Papers </b></summary>
<p>
  The 2023 Workshop on Platform Analytics (WoPA) is a single-track, multidisciplinary workshop presenting new research on platform analytics. 

<p>
Platforms enable direct interactions between diverse groups of agents. Marketplaces connect buyers and sellers; media platforms connect advertisers, creators and viewers; sharing platforms connect resource owners with resource users; app stores connect developers and users. Platforms are pervasive in the digital economy. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11002-014-9314-1" target="_blank">Sriram et al. (2014)</a> cover some platform research topics in greater depth and point to foundational literature.

<p>
We construe Platform Analytics broadly as the use of data to improve decisions in platform contexts. Relevant decisions might include platform design, rankings, listings, usage, pricing, advertising, personalization, ratings or reviews. Relevant topics might include: 
<br>-network externalities;
<br>-agent utility, search, matching, purchase or welfare;
<br>-reputation, manipulation, trust or fraud;
<br>-discrimination, diversity or fairness;
<br>-competition within or between platforms;
<br>-data privacy and sharing;
<br>-antitrust or other regulations.
<br>Ideal papers might show how to use platform data to improve decisions in platform contexts.

<p>
WoPA will be held in-person in San Diego on April 7, 2023, and last the full day. The organizers are Minkyung Kim (UNC), Davide Proserpio (USC) and Kenneth C. Wilbur (UCSD). The workshop is sponsored by the <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty-research/usc-marshall-initiative-digital-competition">USC Marshall Initiative on Digital Competition</a>.

<p>
We invite working papers on platform analytics for a competitive submission process. We welcome relevant submissions from industry or any academic discipline, including computer science, economics, information systems, marketing, operations or others. Please send full papers to workshoponplatformanalytics@gmail.com by November 1, 2022. 

<p>
We will notify authors of accepted papers in December. Submitting authors will be invited for priority registration. The program will be posted at <a href="https://platformanalytics.org">PlatformAnalytics.org</a>. 

<p>
We kindly ask for help distributing this announcement to interested researchers.
